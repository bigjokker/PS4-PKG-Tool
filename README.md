# Requirement

# Features

- Drag and drop PKG folders onto the window to load them.
- Grouped list view. Group your library by Title, Title ID, Category, System Version, or PKG Type.
- Title column visible in the main grid so game names are shown without clicking.

- Rename PKG using naming presets or a custom format with placeholders.
- Move and organize PKGs into folders by title, category, region, or type.
- View PKG information: param.sfo, trophy list, entries, and change info.

- Trophy metadata viewer with names, descriptions, and grades.
- Latest Update column shows the newest available update version per PKG.

- Filter the grid by category (Game, Patch, Addon, App) or search by filename, title, or ID.
- Set backport labels and check for duplicate PKGs.
- Export your PKG list to Excel.
- Send PKGs to PS4 over the network using Remote Package Installer.
- Check PS5 backward compatibility.

# How to use Remote Package Installer

This is only compatible with PS4 firmware that can run Flatz's Remote Package Installer app. Split update PKG files are currently not supported.

- Open the program settings.
- Set the IP addresses for your PC and PS4.
- Install Node.js and the http-server module (ensure that Node.js is allowed through the firewall).
- If you are unable to install the http-server module via the PS4 PKG Tool, try restarting the tool and reinstalling the module. Alternatively, run `npm install http-server -g` manually in the command prompt.
- Save the changes and exit the program settings.
- Launch the Remote Package Installer app on your PS4.
- Select the PKG file you wish to install, right-click on it, and choose 'Send PKG to PS4'.
